Regression tests for ARP implementation in the kernel.

The test suite runs on the machine LOCAL, the kernel under test is
running on DST.  On LOCAL Scapy is generating ARP packes ans sends
them to DST.  The replys to LOCAL are analyzed.  The kernel log files
are fetched from DST via SCP and grepped for messages.  The arp
table of DST is inspected via SSH login.
