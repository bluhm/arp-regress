Regression tests for ARP implementation in the kernel.

The test suite runs on the machine LOCAL, the kernel under test is
running on REMOTE.  On LOCAL Scapy is generating ARP packes ans sends
them to REMOTE.  The replys to LOCAL are analyzed.  The kernel log files
are fetched from REMOTE via SCP and grepped for messages.  The arp
table of REMOTE is inspected via SSH login.
